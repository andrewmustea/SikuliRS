# SikuliRS

SikuliRS is a collection of software tools that uses the Sikuli automation platform to automate some of the annoying and repetitive tasks in Old School Runescape.

I'm using this project as a learning tool to become better developer and to get more acquainted with JavaFX and Sikuli.

I'm working on this project on my own time so there may be a long wait between major commits to the baseline.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback so please feel free to send me any ideas or comments at the1zenijr@yahoo.com.
